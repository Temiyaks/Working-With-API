# webscraping
Web scrapping.  The goal of web scraping is to access data from a website or webpage. Sometimes a website can make it easier for a user to have direct access to their data with the use of an API(Application Programming Interface). This means that the company has made a set of dedicated URLs that provide this data, it usually comes in a JSON( JavaScript Object Notation) format.  This JSON  often contains nested lists and dictionaries. In this project, I will explain how to query an API with JSON output, process this data to read it into a pandas dataframe, and save it to a CSV file.  I decided to use the allbirds website. Itâ€™s a Shopify site where users buy and order items.
